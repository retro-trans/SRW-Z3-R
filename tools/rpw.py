"""Read and write RPW_DATA.CPK -- the game's core string/data table.

An `<mt>prod` container of 24 tagged chunks. The 登場作品 series label, unit
names, weapon names, spirit commands, skill text and battle quotes all come
from here (chunk `j-string`: 4,565 NUL-separated cp932 strings). The zukan
library's PRDC field is NOT what the game draws for that label -- found when
a translated PRDC still showed Japanese on screen.

Chunk layout, verified on all 24 chunks:

    <chunk-head>  name padded to 8 bytes  u32 total  u32 body
    body          (j-string: strings joined by NUL)
    <chunk-foot>  u32  <endofchunk>

    total = bytes from '<chunk-head>' through the end of '<endofchunk>'
    body  = bytes between the header and '<chunk-foot>'

A short name (pilot, robot, skill) is padded -- reading the u32s straight
after the name gives garbage, which is what made those chunks look corrupt.

File header `<mt>prod#1 .. data#1 .. 1.00` then u32 file-total, u32 file-body;
both are recomputed when a chunk changes length.
